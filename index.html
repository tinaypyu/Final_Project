                    <p> The Mentorship Program is something that is very important to TWSA. Every Fall semester, we pair up incoming freshmen or transfer students with a student who has been a UM student for at least a year. Any question you may have, whether it is about classes, living in the US, social activities, your mentor is there to help! We also have monthly mentorship events for mentors and mentee to bond. </p>
